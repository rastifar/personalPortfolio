## Project Overview

This project was created based on a tutorial I followed a few years ago.
The tutorial provided a comprehensive guide on creating a personal portfolio using React.js. 
I implemented the project to enhance my understanding of React and also make a personal portfolio for myself.

### Technologies Used

•  React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI 
   components and manages the state of the application efficiently.

### Libraries and Frameworks
•  react-on-screen : used to track the visibility of components on the screen. This is particularly useful for 
   triggering animations or lazy-loading content only when it becomes visible to the user.

•  react-multi-carousel :  Used for a responsive carousel component that allows for multiple items to be 
   displayed at once. It is highly customizable and supports various breakpoints to ensure a seamless 
   experience across different devices.

•  Animate.css: animate.css is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations. It is used to add 
   animations to elements in the React app, enhancing the user experience with smooth and engaging visual 
   effects..

•  React-bootstrap : provides Bootstrap components as React components, making it easier to use Bootstrap's 
   responsive design and pre-styled components within a React application. This helps in building a consistent 
   and visually appealing UI quickly.

 •  Bootstrap : is a popular CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides a 
    wide range of pre-designed components and utilities that help in building a consistent and responsive 
    layout.

## Features
•  Responsive Design: Ensures the web page looks good on all devices.

•  Interactive Elements: Includes navigation, and animations.

•  Consistent Styling: Mimics the color scheme, fonts, and layout of the famous online shop.
